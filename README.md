### Some of my work

#### Research


- [Sequential Neural Posterior and Likelihood Approximation](https://github.com/SamuelWiqvist/snpla)

    A paper on neural density estimation where we present an algorithm that learns both the posterior and likelihood of the model.  

- [Efficient inference for stochastic differential mixed-effects models using correlated particles pseudo-marginal algorithms](https://github.com/SamuelWiqvist/efficient_SDEMEM)

    In this paper, we use correlated particle pseudo-marginal Metropolis-Hastings (CPMMH) for accelerating inference for stochastic differential equation mixed-effects models (SDEMEMs). 
    
- [Partially Exchangeable Networks and Architectures for Learning Summary Statistics in Approximate Bayesian Computation](https://github.com/SamuelWiqvist/PENs-and-ABC)

    A deep learning paper where we introduce the novel architecture *partially exchangeable networks* (PEN). In the paper, we use PEN for learning summary statistics for ABC.

- [Accelerating delayed-acceptance Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms](https://github.com/SamuelWiqvist/adamcmcpaper)

    An MCMC paper where we develop an accelerated version of the delayed-acceptance algorithm. As a case study, we consider the computational challenging and highly complex problem of modeling protein folding.

#### Tutorials

- [Implementation of some ABC algorithms in Julia](https://github.com/SamuelWiqvist/ApproximateBayesianComputation.jl)

    Generic implementations of some ABC algorithms in Julia.

- [Introduction to likelihood-free inference](https://github.com/SamuelWiqvist/introlikelihoodfree)

    An introductory Jupyter notebook tutorial on likelihood-free inference.
    
#### Talks

- [Pioneers-pp: Bayesian statistics and ABC talk](https://github.com/SamuelWiqvist/pioneers-pp-abc-talk)

    Slides, examples, and computer exercises for my presentation at the *Pioneers of Probabilistic Programming* Meet-up group.

- [Bayes@Lund 2019](https://github.com/SamuelWiqvist/bayesatlund2019presentation)

    Slides for my talk at Bayes@Lund 2019.
